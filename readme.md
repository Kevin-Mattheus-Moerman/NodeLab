## NodeLab 
  NodeLab is a simple MATLAB-package for node-generation and adaptive refinement for meshfree modeling in arbitrary domains. The final output is two variables, which can be seen in the 'workspace'.
  * *xy* array having interior nodes.
  * *bdy* array having boundary nodes. 

### Installation
* Download the package on your PC. 
* Open MATLAB
* Go to the directory 'NodeLab'
* run the script 'setup.m'. This will add different directories of the NodeLab on your MATLAB path â€” only for the current session. Now you are ready to run the demos and generate nodes for your own project.
