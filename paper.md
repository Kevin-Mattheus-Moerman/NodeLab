# Summary
Meshfree methods are cutting-edge numerical methods for numerical modeling, which unlike other mesh-based algorithm do not require an structured grid/elements in the domain. 
Many real-world applications (like weather forecasting, tsunami modeling, and geophysical imaging) require to generate a large number of nodes in a significantly large arbitrary domain. Unlike the mesh-generation in the finite element method (FEM), the literature in node-generation for meshless computing is sparse. To make the present work reproducible and applicable, as a first step, we propose an approach for node generation, and refinement in arbitrary 2D domains. Some previous works regarding the node generation for meshfree computing --- especially, in the context of RBF-FD method are: \citep{fornberg2015fast,michaels2017node,shankar2018robust,vlasiuk2017fast,zamolo2018two}.

``NodeLab`` is a MATLAB-based library for unstructured node-generation and adaptive refinement for meshfree modeling in arbitrary domains.
